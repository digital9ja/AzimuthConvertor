Just a simple python program I wrote to calculate bearings based on input from the user.

This is one site that can be used to find magnetic declination values for your area or an area of interest:

I take no responsibility, legal or otherwise, for the use of the software. It is not intended for anything but academic study.

If you are going to be using a map and compass for any kind of navigation I strongly encourage you to get professional training.
Here's a good site to check for an orienteering club:

Also, anytime you are using a map and compass for land navigation you should buddy up with someone who also knows how to use a map and compass correctly.

Have fun, stay found, stay safe.
